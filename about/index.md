I am a second year student at The National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute".
This is kind of portfolio where I am going to write posts about my learning adventure and about the future projects.
The main idea of the website is to make learning proccess more interesting and to create a visit card.
