I'm a 2-nd year student at The National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute" and I am learning programming. Actually, C# and Unity 3D. I'm fond of English language as well, so sometimes I'll make some english posts and the stuff

This is kind of portfolio where I am going to write posts about my learning adventure and about the future projects.

The main idea of the website is 
* to make learning proccess more interesting
* to create a visit card 
* to create the platform for the future projects
* to practice English language
