My name is Andrew and I'm a 2-nd year student at *The National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute"* and I am learning programming. Actually, **C#** and **Unity 3D**. I'm fond of **English language** as well.

This is kind of portfolio where I am going to write posts about my learning adventure and about the future projects and as I like English language I'll sometimes write posts in English.

The main idea of the website is
* to create a visit card  
* to make learning proccess more interesting
* to create the platform for the future projects
* to practice English language
